## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a system management that would help hospital share patients
data amongst themselves, so that whichever hospital the patients visits they will have full medical
information about themselves from all other hospital he/she has attended, in other to provide better
professional medical services to the patients

## 1.2 Constraints and Limitation

**Limitations** :

```
● Implementing this project would require collaborating with different hospital to see what kind of
data they would allow to share of the patient, so we hardcoded everything to hypothetically
demonstrate how the system would work.

```
# 1.3. System Features

```
❏ Authentication and Authorization: we implemented authentication and authorization in this
system to secure our application.
❏ CRUD operation Patient data: we add a CRUD operation of patients data, as we will be gathering
data from the patient, we implement some features that will help us get that data.
```
# 1.4. Project Plan

We divided our project into two different parts **_frontend_** and **_backendphases,_** these phases will be
achieved in different timelines as they require different deliverables.

```
● Frontend: : in this part will be implementing the frontend design of our application, as we will
need a user interface for interact with our application.
● Backend: : in this part will be implementing the backend logic of our application, ever
```

# 1.5. Technical Requirement

To implement this project we have used different technologies where on the **_frontend_** we have used
HTML, CSS and Javascript, where on the **_backendphases_** we have used Java, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
